I build and lead teams of client facing engineers responsible for the SDKs, tools, and and technical documentation customers need to integrate SaaS services into their products.

My focus is optimizing the Developer Experience for self service. I also serve Sales and Customer Success teams with a technical escalation process for enterprise customers.
