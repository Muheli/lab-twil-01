# The B2B Tech Hook

## About Me

Twelve years ago, I narrowed my career focus.
I doubled down on building engineering teams who interact directly with B2B customers.
For 20 years prior, I built video games and other applications who's customers were the end users.

I fell into B2B Tech when a video game publisher I worked for pivoted from making games to offering
social gaming features for other publishers to integrate into their games [ [1] ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint).
I was struck by factors that distinguish a B2B Tech startup from the B2C world I was accustomed to. I was hooked.

## B2B, B2C – A Subtle Comparison

In their startup phase, all businesses face a [Business Viability Checklist](#§02):

- Define your value proposition
- Find your market
- Gain Economies of Scale
- Deliver ROI

While every startup has a limited amount of time to prove viability,
B2B tends to be more tolerant of incremental progress through this list with room for refinement at each step.
B2C tends to require more simultaneous progress on all checklist items at each stage of growth.
These differences are a matter of degree but generally mean that B2B success relies on good feedback loops
optimized for solving narrowly defined business problems while B2C has to satisfy a more wholistic set of customer expectations.

## Developers As B2B Customers

When software developers are your B2B customers, they are often weighing the prospect
of using your product versus building their own solutions. If your product is easy to work with, they are likely to give it a try at least as a placeholder that they may learn from and replace in the future.

Developers are problem solvers first and many of them will find it in their interest to help you refine your solution both for your benefit and their own. 
By cultivating good relationships with the community of developers who use your product, you will have the opportunity to gain their trust and include them in the feedback loop that keeps your product competitive. The same community is aslo a powerful vehicle for growth in your market.
