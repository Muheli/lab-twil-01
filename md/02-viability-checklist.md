# The Business Viability Checklist

All businesses are faced with a **_Business Viability Checklist_**:
- Define your value proposition
- Find your market
- Gain Economies of Scale
- Deliver ROI

The trick to sustainability is to meet these measures without exhausting capital.

## Solve A Problem For A Customer
When you can solve a problem for one customer, you have a value proposition.
When the value to the customer is higher than your cost to deliver your solution, you have a profit margin.
You don't have to show a profit on your early customers as long as you are able to
scale your business before your run out of capital.

## Show That You Can Repeat It
After solving a problem for one customer, show that you can repeat the process.
You have to show not only the ability to replicate your solution but also the process
of acquiring customers from a potential customer base that won't be exhausted
as long as you intend to remain in business.

## Show That It Gets Easier As You Accelerate
After demonstrating a repeatable process in a market with proven potential,
show that you can refine the whole process with increasing efficiences.
Even though a big business seems inherently more complex than a small one,
a more important measure is the ratio of complexity over output.
If the relative complexity and relative cost per unit of output increases
as the business grows, it should become relatively easier to increase profitability.

## Replace Capital Faster Than You Spend It
There is no real business without ROI. If all goes well, you will replace your starting capital and compensate
for accumulated interest and risk.
Even if all of your starting capital was lent by an outside investor, uncompensated skill and effort it took to build
the business added "sweat equity" deserves consideration in dividend compensation. If the business continues to grow,
accumulating profits can be parlayed back into the business or shared among outstanding equity holders.
